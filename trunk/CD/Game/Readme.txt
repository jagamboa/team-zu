To start Forsaken, go to the folder named "Game" and click the batch file "StartGame"

Once the game loads, the application window will appear.

The main menu has the options "Start the Game", "Instructions" and "Level Editor"

To advance cutscenes, either click the screen or push the spacebar.

At the main menu, if you push the sequence: "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a"
it will enable "Frost Mode" aka "God Mode".  This will cause the girl sprite to be invincible.
Also, you can skip levels by pushing the shift button.





How to use the Level Editor:

The level consists of a Grid of squares, each of which can hold a Tile and
a Piece.

By default, the level starts with no pieces and empty tiles.

To select a piece or a tile to place on the Level, click the piece/tile on the
palette on the bottom menu bar.  

Click anywhere on the level to paint the selected piece/tile onto the level.

The rotate button (the circle arrow) can be pressed to rotate the Arrow panels.
Also, this rotation affects which way the patroling enemies will initially move.

The X button next to the rotate button is used to delete pieces.  If this button is clicked, then when
the user clicks on the level the pieces/tiles clicked will be reset to empty tiles.

There can only be one Girl piece on the Level Editor, and there can only be one Glutton piece as well.
